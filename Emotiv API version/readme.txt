About
=====
A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a computer device that helps a person operate a
computer by using his brain waves. Brain waves are patterns of electrical brain activity.
Brain cells can communicate with each other by electricity and chemicals called
neurotransmitters. The electrical activity of the brain is measured by a test called the
electroencephalogram (EEG). For this test, tiny metal discs called electrodes are
painlessly stuck to the scalp. These electrodes can pick up the electrical impulses of the
brain, which pass through the skull. Brain waves measured by EEG do not represent a
particular thought or movement, but rather represent a summary of brain electrical
activity at a recording point on the scalp. Brain waves can be altered by thoughts of
planned action (such as thinking of moving a hand), without actually moving the hand
itself. This ability to think of a movement can be used to actually move a computer
cursor or a prosthetic arm.

Person authentication aims to accept or reject a person claiming an identity. There
are two phases. First phase is the sampling phase. In this phase user has to give his samples.
Then user can lock his screen. This is the second phase where in user can unlock the screen by 
giving his appropriate brain signals.

System Requirements
===================

Software Requirements
---------------------
- Operating system : Microsoft Windows XP/Windows Vista
- Execution Environment: .Net Framework 3.5 or lower version, MATLAB(c) Compiler Runtime 7.11 or later
- Software Development Kit: Emotiv Education Edition SDK

Hardware Requirements
---------------------
- 2.4 GHz Intel Pentium 4 processor (or higher).
- 1GB RAM.
- Two unused USB 2.0 ports (You need additional ports if you use more than one Emotiv headsets simultaneously)
- Support for Wireless Dongle

Installation
============
 1) Create a folder 'APPNAME/bin' (ScreenLock or any convinient name)
 2) Copy all files in the ScreenLock/bin dirctory on CD
 3) Open folder 'APPNAME/bin'
 4) Right-click on the file 'ScreenLock.exe', highlight 'send to' and click on Desktop(create         shortcut).
 5) Close the folder
 
Usage
=====

Training
--------
 1) Double-click the file 'ScreenLock.exe' on the Desktop or Double-click the file 'ScreenLock.exe' in     'APPNAME/bin/' Folder
 2) Wear Emotiv EPOC headset and Click on Add User
 3) Choose Authentication type. Cube based or Meditation based
 4) Train the system (Application will guide you through this process)
    Lock/Unlock Screen
------------------
  Lock Screen 
  -----------
	 1) Double-click the file 'ScreenLock.exe' on the Desktop or Double-click the file 'ScreenLock.exe' in 'APPNAME/bin/' Folder
	 2) Click on Lock Screen. Now screen will be locked
 	    Unlock Screen
  -------------
	 1) Enter username and Click on Unlock button 
	 2) Wear Emotiv EPOC headset and perform appropriate actions. Application will guide you through this process
	 
NOTE
======
-If headset is not working properly or Contact Quality is too low, this application might not work as expected. If Contact Quality is too low, application will lock the screen infinitely until you feed in correct signals.
