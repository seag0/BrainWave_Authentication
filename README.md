PERSON AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM USING BRAIN WAVES AS BIOMETRIC
========================

A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a computer device that helps a person operate a
computer by using his brain waves. Brain waves are patterns of electrical brain activity.
Brain cells can communicate with each other by electricity and chemicals called
neurotransmitters. The electrical activity of the brain is measured by a test called the
electroencephalogram (EEG). For this test, tiny metal discs called electrodes are
painlessly stuck to the scalp. These electrodes can pick up the electrical impulses of the
brain, which pass through the skull. Brain waves measured by EEG do not represent a
particular thought or movement, but rather represent a summary of brain electrical
activity at a recording point on the scalp. Brain waves can be altered by thoughts of
planned action (such as thinking of moving a hand), without actually moving the hand
itself. This ability to think of a movement can be used to actually move a computer
cursor or a prosthetic arm.

In this project, we investigate the use of brain activity for person authentication. It has
been shown in previous studies that the brain-wave pattern of every individual is unique
and that the electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used for biometric authentication.
Person authentication aims to accept or reject a person claiming an identity. We
perform EEG recording, feature extraction and matching of the feature vector with the
stored feature vector all in real time. We also show that there are some mental tasks
that are more appropriate for person authentication than others.
